# Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis


Two datasets are available: train and test. The train dataset comprises of 2400 reviews, while the test dataset comprises of 600 reviews. The train dataset is used for model training, and the test dataset is used for evaluation.

To conduct sentiment analysis on the reviews, NLP techniques were employed, categorizing the target variable polarity as either 0 or 1 for each sentence. Various text preprocessing steps were taken, including converting all sentences to lower case, eliminating punctuation, removing stop words, excluding frequently used words, eliminating rare words, and stemming.
